The projects involved three major civil engineering tasks: (1) structural analysis and design of a steel structure building, (2) structural analysis and design of a concrete structure building, and (3) highway design. Each project started with given architectural plans, requiring independent execution of structural and transportation engineering tasks, including load calculations, material selection, and compliance with design standards.
For the structural design projects, industry-standard software such as ETABS, SAP2000, and AutoCAD was used for structural modeling, load analysis, and design verification. Hand calculations, based on ACI standards were used to validate results and ensure structural integrity. The design process included gravity load analysis, lateral load resistance (wind and seismic), member sizing, and reinforcement detailing for both steel and concrete structures.
The highway design project incorporated geometric design principles following AASHTO guidelines and utilized software such as Civil 3D for horizontal and vertical alignment, superelevation, and pavement thickness design. Traffic considerations, safety analysis, and cost efficiency were also factored into the final design.
Additionally, custom MALTAB scripts and spreadsheets were developed to automate calculations, improving accuracy and efficiency in structural and transportation design. This project demonstrates a comprehensive engineering workflow, integrating software tools with theoretical methodologies to achieve optimized and practical design solutions.
